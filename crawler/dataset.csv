ISYS2405,"Rapid changes in software engineering practices and advances in underlying hardware have resulted in exponential growth in the scope, scale and complexity of software systems over the last 20 years. Parallel systems and systems created through composition have added a new dimension to this complexity. Large software systems today can contain many concurrent components interacting in complex ways. New techniques have to be developed to ensure that the interaction between components do not violate overriding goals and constraints. Constraints can include e.g. synchronisation, timing and semantic constraints. This is a reading course where students are expected to survey a number of recent papers relating to the topic of software engineering for large scale systems. Students are expected to critically analyze papers and make regular presentations. The first few weeks of the course will highlight topics in software architecture, modelling of concurrency systems and parallel computing. Students will be allocated topics within the above areas of interest and will be expected to work closely with one or more teaching/research staff","A primary objective of this course is to prepare prospective postgraduate research students for independent research under supervision in this and related areas.
